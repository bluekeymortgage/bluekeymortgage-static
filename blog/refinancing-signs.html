    <section class="section-light">
        <div class="container" style="max-width: 800px;">
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: #1F2937; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Refinancing your mortgage isn't just about getting a lower interest rate. It can be a strategic financial move to help you achieve various goals—from accessing equity to consolidating debt. Here are the key signs that refinancing might make sense for you.</p>

            <h2>Sign #1: Interest Rates Have Dropped Significantly</h2>
            <p>The most common reason to refinance is to secure a lower interest rate. Even a 0.5% reduction can save you thousands over the life of your mortgage.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> On a $400,000 mortgage with 20 years remaining, dropping your rate from 5% to 4.5% could save you approximately $20,000 in interest over the remaining term.</p>
            <p><strong>Rule of thumb:</strong> If you can reduce your rate by at least 0.5% and plan to stay in your home for at least 2-3 more years, refinancing is worth exploring.</p>

            <h2>Sign #2: You Have High-Interest Debt</h2>
            <p>Credit cards, personal loans, and car loans typically carry much higher interest rates than mortgages. Consolidating this debt into your mortgage can:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Reduce your monthly payments significantly</li>
                <li>Save thousands in interest charges</li>
                <li>Simplify your finances with one payment</li>
                <li>Improve your credit score over time</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If you're paying 19.99% on $30,000 in credit card debt, refinancing to include that debt at 4.5% can save you over $4,500 per year in interest alone.</p>

            <h2>Sign #3: Your Home Has Significantly Increased in Value</h2>
            <p>If your home's value has appreciated substantially, you may have access to more equity than you realize. You can tap into this equity to:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Fund major renovations or repairs</li>
                <li>Invest in rental properties</li>
                <li>Start or grow a business</li>
                <li>Pay for education expenses</li>
                <li>Create an emergency fund</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In Ontario, lenders typically allow you to borrow up to 80% of your home's appraised value, minus your existing mortgage balance.</p>

            <h2>Sign #4: You Want to Shorten Your Mortgage Term</h2>
            <p>If your financial situation has improved since you took out your mortgage, refinancing to a shorter term can:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Help you own your home outright sooner</li>
                <li>Save substantial interest over the life of the loan</li>
                <li>Build equity faster</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> While your monthly payments will be higher with a shorter term, the long-term savings can be significant.</p>

            <h2>Sign #5: You Want to Switch from Variable to Fixed (or Vice Versa)</h2>
            <p>Market conditions change, and so do your preferences for certainty vs. potential savings:</p>
            <p><strong>Switch to fixed if:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
                <li>Interest rates are rising and you want payment stability</li>
                <li>You prefer predictable monthly payments for budgeting</li>
                <li>You're risk-averse and want protection from rate increases</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Switch to variable if:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>You believe rates will decline or stay low</li>
                <li>You're comfortable with payment fluctuations</li>
                <li>You want lower rates and more flexibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sign #6: Your Credit Score Has Improved Dramatically</h2>
            <p>If your credit score has increased significantly since you first got your mortgage, you may now qualify for better rates and terms. This is especially true if your score was below 700 when you first borrowed and is now above 750.</p>

            <h2>Sign #7: You're Approaching Retirement</h2>
            <p>As you near retirement, refinancing can help you:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Reduce monthly payments to fit a fixed income</li>
                <li>Pay off your mortgage before you stop working</li>
                <li>Access equity for retirement planning</li>
                <li>Eliminate high-interest debt before retirement</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #FEF3C7; border-left: 4px solid #F59E0B; padding: 2rem; margin: 3rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Important: Calculate the Break-Even Point</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Refinancing comes with costs (legal fees, appraisal, potential penalties). Calculate how long it will take for your savings to offset these costs. If you plan to move before reaching the break-even point, refinancing may not make sense.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>When Refinancing Might NOT Make Sense</h2>
            <p>Refinancing isn't always the right move. Avoid refinancing if:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>You're planning to move within 1-2 years</li>
                <li>The penalty for breaking your current mortgage is very high</li>
                <li>Your home value has declined significantly</li>
                <li>Your credit score has dropped substantially</li>
                <li>You're adding debt just to spend on non-essential items</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #F9FAFB; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 8px; margin: 3rem 0; text-align: center;">
