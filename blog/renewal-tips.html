        <div class="container" style="max-width: 800px;">
            <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: #1F2937; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">When your mortgage renewal notice arrives, don't just sign it and send it back! That's exactly what your lender is counting on—and it could cost you thousands of dollars.</p>

            <h2>The Renewal Reality: Most People Overpay</h2>
            <p>Here's a shocking statistic: <strong>Over 60% of Canadian homeowners simply accept their lender's renewal offer without shopping around.</strong></p>
            <p>Why? Because it's easy, convenient, and requires no effort. But that convenience is expensive.</p>
            <p><strong>The average Canadian could save $2,000-$5,000 over a 5-year term simply by negotiating or switching lenders at renewal.</strong></p>

            <h2>Why Your Lender Gives You a Higher Rate</h2>
            <p>Your lender knows you're unlikely to shop around, so they offer you a rate that's typically 0.5-1.0% higher than what they offer new customers or what you could get elsewhere.</p>
            <p>They're betting on your inertia—and they usually win.</p>

            <div style="background-color: #EFF6FF; border-left: 4px solid #2563EB; padding: 2rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Real Example: The Cost of Not Shopping</h3>
                <p><strong>Mortgage Balance:</strong> $400,000 remaining</p>
                <p><strong>Renewal Offer:</strong> 5.5% (5-year fixed)</p>
                <p><strong>Market Rate Available:</strong> 4.5% (5-year fixed)</p>
                <p><strong>Monthly Payment Difference:</strong> $227</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>5-Year Savings:</strong> $13,620 by switching!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Renewal Timeline: When to Act</h2>
            <p>Your lender must send your renewal offer <strong>21 days before your term expires</strong> (though most send it 120 days early).</p>
            <p><strong>Best timeline for action:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>120 days out:</strong> Receive renewal offer, don't sign yet!</li>
                <li><strong>90-60 days out:</strong> Start shopping for rates with a broker</li>
                <li><strong>60-30 days out:</strong> Compare offers and negotiate</li>
                <li><strong>30-21 days out:</strong> Make final decision</li>
                <li><strong>Renewal date:</strong> New mortgage takes effect</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4 Strategies to Get the Best Renewal Rate</h2>

            <h3>Strategy #1: Shop Multiple Lenders</h3>
            <p>This is where a mortgage broker shines. We can:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Compare rates from 5+ lenders in minutes</li>
                <li>Present you with a clear comparison</li>
                <li>Handle all the paperwork</li>
                <li>Find lenders your current bank can't match</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Best part:</strong> Shopping doesn't affect your credit score or obligate you to switch.</p>

            <h3>Strategy #2: Negotiate with Your Current Lender</h3>
            <p>Armed with competing offers, call your current lender's retention department (not the branch) and say:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 2rem; font-style: italic;">"I've received offers from other lenders at [rate]. Can you match or beat this?"</p>
            <p>They often will! Lenders hate losing customers and may offer:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Rate match or better</li>
                <li>Cash-back incentives</li>
                <li>Waived fees</li>
                <li>Prepayment privileges</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategy #3: Switch Lenders</h3>
            <p>If your current lender won't budge and you found a significantly better rate elsewhere, switching is straightforward:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>No penalty:</strong> At renewal, you can switch with zero penalty</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal costs:</strong> $300-$500 in legal fees (some lenders cover this)</li>
                <li><strong>Quick process:</strong> Usually 2-3 weeks</li>
                <li><strong>Same property:</strong> No re-appraisal typically needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Strategy #4: Blend-and-Extend (Early Renewal)</h3>
            <p>If rates are dropping and you're within 120 days of renewal, some lenders let you renew early by "blending" your current rate with the new rate.</p>
            <p><strong>When it makes sense:</strong> If rates have dropped 1%+ since you locked in your current rate.</p>

            <h2>Red Flags in Renewal Offers</h2>
            <p>Watch out for these tactics:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Highlighted "No Action Required":</strong> They want you to do nothing and accept</li>
                <li><strong>Short response deadline:</strong> Pressure to sign quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Posted rates:</strong> Almost always higher than negotiable rates</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced prepayment privileges:</strong> Check if they're taking away flexibility</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When You Should NOT Switch</h2>
            <p>Sometimes staying with your current lender makes sense:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                <li>Your rate is already extremely competitive</li>
                <li>You have a special product (like a collateral mortgage) that's hard to switch</li>
                <li>You're planning major renovations and want to access equity soon</li>
                <li>Your current lender matches competing offers</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="background-color: #FEF3C7; border-left: 4px solid #F59E0B; padding: 2rem; margin: 3rem 0; border-radius: 8px;">
                <h3 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Pro Tip: Even If You're Happy</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Even if you love your current lender, always shop around at renewal. Use competing offers to negotiate a better rate. You might stay with your lender—but at a lower rate!</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            <p>Your renewal is an opportunity, not just a formality. Think of it as getting a new mortgage—because you are!</p>
            <p>Every time your term expires, you have leverage to negotiate or switch. Use it.</p>
