                <h2>What is a Reverse Mortgage?</h2>
                <p>A reverse mortgage is a special type of loan for homeowners 55 and older. Instead of making monthly payments to a lender, the lender makes payments to you—based on the equity in your home.</p>
                <p>You stay in your home, keep the title, and receive funds as a lump sum, regular payments, or a line of credit you can access when needed.</p>

                        <p>Generally, a reverse mortgage doesn't affect Old Age Security (OAS) or Canada Pension Plan (CPP). However, it may affect income-tested benefits like the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS). We recommend consulting with a financial advisor.</p>
